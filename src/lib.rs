//! This library implements basic support for running a command in an elevated context.
//!
//! In particular this runs a command through "sudo" or other platform equivalents.
//!
//! ## Basic Usage
//!
//! The library provides a single struct called `Command` which largely follows the
//! API of `std::process::Command`.  However it does not support capturing output or
//! gives any guarantees for the working directory or environment.  This is because
//! the platform APIs do not have support for that either in some cases.
//!
//! In particular the working directory is always the system32 folder on windows and
//! the environment variables are always the ones of the initial system session on
//! OS X if the GUI mode is used.
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use runas::Command;
//!
//! let status = Command::new("rm")
//!     .arg("/usr/local/my-app")
//!     .status()
//!     .unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! ## Platform Support
//!
//! The following platforms are supported:
//!
//! * Windows: always GUI mode
//! * OS X: GUI and CLI mode
//! * Linux: CLI mode
